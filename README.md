## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Docker:** Ensure that Docker is installed on your machine. Follow the official Docker installation guide: [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### Installation Steps

1. Open a terminal.
2. Run the following command to start the Docker containers and build the backend project:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

   This command uses the `docker-compose.yml` configuration file to set up the required services.
3. Ensure that ports 8083, 8084, and 5434 are not already in use on your system.
4. Open port 8084 to see the running app
